# SurfsUp Analysis


## Overview:

We will be reaching out to an investor, W. Avy about opening a surf shop in Oahu. He has concerns over the weather and how that correlates to the business being successful. In order to make an informed decision, we are grabbing the weather data and performing queries to get the “temperature” and later, the “precipitation” numbers. 


## Resources:

•	Hawaii.sqlite 

•	Python 3.7

•	VScode

•	Jupyter Notebook

•	climate_anlaysis.ipynb


## Results:

Here in the June temperature results, we can see the average temp is just under 75 degrees F. The minimum was 64, and the max was 85.

This image is of the June precipitation results. It shows the average at about a ¼ inch. The minimum is 0, and the max is at almost 4 ½.

December temperature results have an average of around 71 degrees F. With the minimum at 56, and the max at 83.

Here is the December rain results. The average is not quite a ¼ inch. While the minimum is once again 0, the max is near 6 ½ inches.

## Summary:


In our analysis, we were able to see that the overall temperatures in June and December were relatively moderate. Seems to me, to be a perfect location to open up a surf shop. The temperature does not fluctuate too high or too low either, meaning that sales reflections for the surf shop should stay consistent on a temperature based analysis. 


To further our analysis, we made queries on the precipitation data as well. That shows us, again, pretty consistent numbers, meaning that it seems like a safe bet for that location. Although, it looks like there is some heavy rainfall days with the maximum in June and December skyrocketing to above 4 inches. My guess would be that sales would plummet on those days. There could be some room for more exploratory business ideas aimed at increasing profits for those rainy days.
